# WaimsAmmoBoxes
Modlet for 7 Days to Die that allows you to box up ammo for easier storage

I've always hated that you can craft nice boxes of ammo but once you open them, you can't restack them later.
Well now you can! 

This Modlet adds recipes to create boxes of ammo for all the Vanilla ammo types (and gunpowder) where you can take 100 of a given ammo type and re-box it. 

The ammo still has to be 'unboxed' to be loaded into weapons.
